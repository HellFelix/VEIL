only with a separate license agreement.

The Licensor welcomes contact from commercial users and is open to granting licenses at no cost in many cases, particularly for non-profit, educational, or small-scale internal use. 
Licensing also helps the Licensor understand how the Software is being used and ensures fair, transparent use by all parties.

To request a commercial license, please include:

The Licensee shall not make the Software, or any derivative work thereof, available to third parties via public networks, cloud infrastructure, web services, shared systems, 
or VPN-as-a-service models.

However, nothing in this section shall prohibit the Licensee from deploying or self-hosting the Software for their **own personal, private use**, including operating a private VPN server, 
provided that such deployment:
(a) is not made accessible to commercial entities or third parties for compensation or in a professional context;  
(b) is not operated on behalf of any organization, institution, or business; and  
(c) does not otherwise constitute commercial use as defined in Section 2.

substantial portions of the Software, and provided that such redistribution does not violate Sections 2 through 4.
