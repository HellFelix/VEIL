# VEIL - Verified Encrypted Internet Link

## Installation
**Note: The server runs using raw sockets from userspace, which is generally disallowed on MacOS and Windows.** 
It may be possible to unlock raw sockets to allow the server crate to run on these systems, although realistically, 
running on linux is currently the only viable option.

### Manual
Both client and server system can be installed manually by cloning this repository.
``git clone git@github.com:HellFelix/VEIL.git && cd VEIL``
Then build the necessary crates. Note that the server and client systems are built independently
```
./build.sh server
```
```
./build.sh client
```
Having built the client crates, the ctl tool and systemd service can then be installed using the installation script
```
./client_install.sh
```
Similarly, these tools can be uninstalled using
```
./client_uninstall.sh
```

### Certificates
VEIL operates on CA certificates, using [rustls](https://crates.io/crates/rustls) for authentication and safe
client-server communication.

#### Recommended setup:
- Generate root- and server certificates on the server-side side using the `crypt-setup.sh` script.
- When adding a new client, generate a new client certificate on the server-side using the `gen-client-crypt.sh` 
script and copy certificates to the client machine using a safe transfer tool such as `scp`. Note that the client
system requires the public root and server certificates, along with its own certificate key.

## System Overview
**VEIL** is a layer 3 VPN, capturing IP packets on the network layer (layer 3) using TUN (UTUN on macOS). 
Upon connecting to a server, a TLS connection is established, followed by a DHCP-like four way handshake, where
the client and server agree upon a session ID and an internal IP address for the client (172.16.x.x by default). By default,
the server's internal IP address will be 172.16.0.1, which can be pinged directly from the client because the TUN/UTUN interface
is set up to serve `CLIENT_INTERNAL -> SERVER_INTERNAL`. Thus, after authentication, one might ping the server using
```ping SERVER_INTERNAL```

### Server
The machine running the server program acts as a "dumb tunnel", forwarding packets from trusted client devices (currently supports
TCP, UDP, and ICMP). See [server documentation](./server/README.md) for details on how the program works.

### Client
Running the client service on a device will allow the device to connect to another device running the server. Having connected
to a server, one must then route traffic through the TUN/UTUN interface which is setup during connection. The logs will 
show what the interface is called. If everything was run correctly, you will see the following:
```
[INFO]: Successfully initialized INTERFACE_NAME interface
```

Then, using the `route` command, one can route traffic through the new interface. Note that this can be done for individual 
hosts or globaly depending on use case.
After routing is correctly set up, traffic will now go through the tunnel.
